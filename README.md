####################### Data Analysis using Spark #######################

Concept:
Performing Word Co-occurence algorithm to get 2-Gram and 3-Gram results on database of Latin text files using Apache Spark.

Implementation:
* This project has been developed in Jupyter environment by installing "pyspark" package.
* A large data set of Latin text files is used perform 2-Gram and 3-Gram Word Co-occurence.
* The Latin words are lemmatized before being considered for pairing up.
* Execution time based comparison is performed to analyse performance of Apache Spark architecture.
* Please refer the following project description for in depth details of the activities: https://github.com/Sumedh0192/Data-Mining-and-Computing/blob/master/Data-Processing-in-Spark/Project-Description.pdf
